This document provides instructions on how to use this software to launch 
Elastic Sewing Machine simulations. For compiling the software please refer
to "Building Instructions.txt".



=== Running with option file ===

The following command launches the program with a specified option file:

BASimulator -r 1 -f options.txt



=== Running with manually specified options ===

The following syntax can be used to manually specify the value of certain 
parameters to override that in the option file:

BASimulator -r 1 -f options.txt -- dt 0.01



=== Scripts  ===

The scripts for producing data plotted in the paper (Coiling of Elastic Rods
on Rigid Substrates, Jawed et al., 2014, PNAS) are also included with the
code, in the scripts directory.
